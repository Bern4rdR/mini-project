## Description

This is a simple maze runner game using ray tracing to display from 2D to 3D and a potentiometer to rotate the player POV.

## Tutorial

There are four buttons on the ChipKit. Each button is responsible for the movement in a direction. Button 4 (BTN4) is responsible for moving left, BTN3 for moving forward, BTN2 for moving backwards and BTN1 for moving to the right.

The potientiometer can be used to rotate the players field of view, i.e what the player can see which is also what is displayed on the screen. The potientiometer uses the relative rotation since it can only rotate 270 degress (3/2 PI radians). So if it rotates a third of its rotation to the left then the players field of view will also be rotated a third of its rotation to the left.
